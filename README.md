# Entertainment Graph

A Graph RAG system for entertainment discovery through semantic relationships.

## Project Structure

```
├── specs/
│   ├── overview.md       # Project vision and goals
│   └── phase1.md         # Phase 1 spec (systems, dataset, architecture)
├── research/             # Learning notes on tools (mem0, graphiti, etc.)
├── python/experiments/   # Tool experiments
└── crates/               # Rust packages (Phase 2+)
```

## Approach

**Compare first, then build.** Phase 1 compares existing tools (Mem0, Graphiti, OpenMemory, Pure Vector) to inform our own architecture.

## Status

**Phase 1**: Comparison Framework

See [specs/phase1.md](specs/phase1.md) for current work.
